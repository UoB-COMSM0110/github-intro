# GitHub Intro
Overview of Software Engineering (COMSM0110) Introduction to Git &amp; GitHub.

By the end of this session you should have:
- Created a GitHub account
- One team member should have created a repository.
- All group members should be added to the repository.
- Names, GitHub Usernames Should be added to the README.

This will not be the same repository as the one you will use for your coursework. After this lab we will setup a repository for you using your the GitHub name that you provide us.

## 1. Create a GitHub account

1. Go to [GitHub](www.github.com).
2. Click 'Sign Up' in the top right corner.
3. Follow the instructions on the page. 

*We recommend creating a GitHub account using a personal email address. This will allow you to use the account after leaving the university.*

## 2. Create a repository

Only one member of your team needs to complete this section but everyone should follow along with what they are doing.

1. In the upper-right corner of any page, select plus, then click New repository.

2. Use the 'Owner' dropdown menu to select your GitHub account as the owner of the repository.

3. Choose a repository name (no need to put too much thought into this, this is just a test repository which you can delete later).

## 3. Add team members to your repository

Only one member of your team needs to complete this section but everyone should follow along with what they are doing.

All team members should now have permission to clone the repository and push new or edited code.

## 4. Clone your repository

All team members should complete this section. 

## 5. Edit the README.md

## 6. Send us your repository

## 7. Further tasks on Branches (Optional)

The next essential feature of Git is branches. Take a look at the GitHub [documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/about-branches) on branches and have a go using branches interacting with branches in your test repository. Note: this task has a lot of overlap with Overview of Software Tools.
